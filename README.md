## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Egyptian self-taught Android Engineer, working on Android platform/JVM ecosystem since 2021. I code mainly in Kotlin, and previously in Java. 

Currently, I'm trying to make some baby steps into the backend world by creating server-side apps using Ktor Server framework, I also like trying new languages & technologies.
